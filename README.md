# String-Art-Linear-Algebra
A simple program demonstrating a linear algebra centered approach to generatively creating string art from an input image.

There are three files in this repository, the script that generates a string art image from an input image (also included) and the animation script that was used to generate the manim animation used as this group's presentation.
